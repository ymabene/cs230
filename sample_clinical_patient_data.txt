#Identifier to uniquely specify a patient.	Subtype	Text field to hold cancer type acronym used by TCGA PanCanAtlas.	Legacy DMP patient identifier (DMPnnnn)	Age at which a condition or disease was first diagnosed.	Sex	The extent of a cancer, especially whether the disease has spread from the original site to other parts of the body based on AJCC staging criteria.	The version or edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Handbooks, a publication by the group formed for the purpose of developing a system of clinical staging for cancer that is acceptable to the American medical profession and is compatible with other accepted classifications.	Time interval from the date of last followup to the date of initial pathologic diagnosis, represented as a calculated number of days..	Time interval from a person's date of birth to the date of initial pathologic diagnosis, represented as a calculated number of days.	Time interval from the last day on which a person is known to be alive to the date of initial pathologic diagnosis, represented as a calculated number of days.	The text for reporting information about ethnicity.	Form completion date	Text term to describe the patient's history of neoadjuvant treatment and the kind of treatment given prior to resection of the tumor.	10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.	The third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, published in 2000, used principally in tumor and cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms._The study of the structure of the cells and their arrangement to constitute tissues and, finally, the association among these to form organs.  In pathology, the microscopic process of identifying normal and abnormal morphologic characteristics in tissues, by employing various cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains._A system of numbered categories for representation of data.	The third edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, published in 2000, used principally in tumor and cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms._The description of an anatomical region or of a body part._Named locations of, or within, the body._A system of numbered categories for representation of data.	Informed consent verified	Yes/No/Unknown indicator to identify whether a patient has had a new tumor event after initial treatment.	Code to represent the defined absence or presence of distant spread or metastases (M) to locations via vascular channels or lymphatics beyond the regional lymph nodes, using criteria established by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).	The codes that represent the stage of cancer based on the nodes present (N stage) according to criteria based on multiple editions of the AJCC's Cancer Staging Manual.	Code of pathological T (primary tumor) to define the size or contiguous extension of the primary tumor (T), using staging criteria from the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).	Person neoplasm cancer status.	Primary lymph node presentation assessment.	Prior diagnosis.	The text for reporting information about race.	Radiation Therapy.	Weight measured in kilograms.	Patient Part of PanCan Pathway Analysis	Overall patient survival status.	Overall survival in months since initial diagonosis.	The time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death.	The time period (months) usually begins at the time of diagnosis or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death.	Disease free status since initial treatment.	Disease free (months) since initial treatment.	Progression Free Status	Progress Free Survival (Months)	Genetic ancestries were determined using five different methods as described in Carrot-Zhang et al (2020). These consensus calls were created based on the ancestral population that received the majority of assignments for each patient.
